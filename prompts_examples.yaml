                Core Table Definitions
                1. tblAKHDossier (Main Table)
                Each row in tblAKHDossier represents a single dossier (case file).
                A dossier may contain metadata such as:
                - Identification (ID) --> Example : 'پرونده شماره 142' --> ID = 142
                - tracking fields (Code, FoldNo, CreateDate, etc.)
                - Legal and administrative attributes (JudicatoryGeographicalLocationID, FolderTypeID, StatusTypeID, ResualtID, etc.)
                - References to people, lawyers, clerks, and geographical areas (ComplainID, ConvictID, ClerkID, AdviserID, etc.)
                - Property or asset information (PropertyType, Area, Monetaryvalue, MelkNo, Block, etc.)
                - Status and result tracking (StatusID, ResualtDate, DossierImportanceTypeID, etc.)
                - Textual or descriptive notes (Note, DossierNikName, RefrenceName, etc.)
                This table is the central entity — all other dossier-related tables connect directly or indirectly to it.
                Each row = One legal/administrative dossier record.
                2. tblAKHDossierRow (Document Table)
                Each row in tblAKHDossierRow represents a document or action item related to a specific dossier.
                It is linked to tblAKHDossier via the DossierID field.
                A tblAKHDossierRow maybe called these in persian : زیرپرونده اطلاعات پرونده پرونده های جانبی
                A dossier can have multiple rows (documents), such as:
                - Incoming/outgoing communications (KindEnterExitID, SenderPersonID, ReceiverPersonID)
                - Document metadata (DocCode, KindDocID, GroupID, DoneDate, DocDate, AnswerDate)
                - Legal details (KindDocLegalNatureID, ExpertJusticeTypeLID, CertaintyID)
                - References to sources and sub-documents (SourceId, SourceTable, SourceId2, SourceTable2)
                - Descriptive or HTML notes (Notes, Notes_HTML)
                Each row = One document, correspondence, or step within a dossier.
                Relationship Summary:
                - tblAKHDossierRow.DossierID → tblAKHDossier.ID : Links documents to their parent dossier
                - tblAKHDossier ↔ Other tables (e.g., tblPerson, tblAKHClerk, tblAKHLawyer) : Provides contextual information
                - Type tables ending with 'TypeL' (e.g., tblAKHDossierStatusTypeL, tblAKHKindDocTypeL) : Contain description labels for status, kind, or classification fields
                Instructions for the Model:
                - Treat tblAKHDossier as the main entity describing a dossier or case.
                - Treat tblAKHDossierRow as the collection of related documents or actions belonging to that dossier.
                - Use foreign keys and type tables to interpret meaning (e.g., status IDs, result types, geographical locations).
                - Try to be thorough when getting the information and get tables id mentioned in the main id as well.
                - Notes and fields that have text should be used when the user asks for final results or the subjects of a dossier
